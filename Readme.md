# EDN

Provides support for the [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) format. Which stands for extensible data notation. It turns out to be particularly awesome in Julia because you don't need to make any effort to support custom types. Though if the EDN data was generated by another language you probably still will have to register tagged literal handlers manually.

### Cyclic data support

When a cyclic reference is detected it outputs a reference rather than entering an infinite loop. References look like this `# 1` which is nice because its compact and would otherwise be invalid EDN syntax.
